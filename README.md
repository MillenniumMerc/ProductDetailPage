## Overview

The project makes use of CSS and JS to construct the solution. 

## technology Stack

FrontEnd
The development of User facing side of the stack. Provision of UI and elements to enable access to the core mechanisms of the program. 
I have a lot of time in computers and with that have used many implementations of a FrontEnd to achieve whatever tasks there may be, the interactive aspect of the frontend appeals to myself and the design of that UI gives me satisfaction when elements come together and work as intended.

I learnt a huge amount from this project, upskilled myself from pretty much nowhere in regard to JS, CSS and using the react library. I started the project with a low level grasp on React, js and css and so if I were to do it again, I would prefer to build custom components at the beginning to handle a large array of operations and outcomes. Especially with the input, qty rockers and the responsive design aspects in mind. These components would have changed my project to a more substantial and maintainable piece of work but the skills required to do so were only achieved late in the project timeline.
